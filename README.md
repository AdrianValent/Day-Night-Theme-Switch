# Day-Night-Theme-Switch
This is a static website I made using HTML, CSS and JS and it is responsive for the purpose of user experience on devices with smaller screens. The purpose of this website is to practice making a content that might bring some enjoyment to the users if they enjoy exploring little functions such as this one within different websites.

This website can switch between dark and light themes. In addition there is also the Moon and the Sun depending on which theme is currently being used. Night theme is the default one.

## Experience gained from making this project
* Implementing [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) into my code
* Implementing the open-source lightweight JS library [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) created by [Vincent Garreau](https://github.com/VincentGarreau) and modifying it as needed. This open-source project is licensed under the MIT license.
